In this simple app there are several Text Views and One button view. Text views are stagnat except for the one titled
"count_text_view" which changes to dsplay the number of times the user has pressed the button. 
Included files are the xml file which creates the layout of the app, and the java file that controls what happens when the button is pressed.
